# Janome Embroidery Machine

Janome sewing/embroidery machine horizon memory craft 15000 is used in the Labs.

The following guide explains how to use the embroidery machine, along with the relevant steps one has to take. The guide assumes that you have already installed inkscape.

# Inkscape Plugin Requirements

Ink/Stitch is an [Inkscape plugin](https://inkstitch.org/). Which means you have to have Inkscape installed in order to continue with the tutorial.

Click on install ink/stitch -> Ensure that you download the proper plugin for your respective laptop OS. Once you have downloaded the file and went through the installation prompt - you would want to restart Inkscape.

To know that the plugin was installed properly you can find the extension under Extensions > Ink/Stitch and nothing is grayed out.

**NOTE:**

- If you get an error message saying that Ink/Stitch can't open that means you need to restart Inkscape.

- If you don't already have Inkscape installed on your computer, click <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/" target="_blank">here</a> to download and install.

## Getting started with Ink/Stitch

To do your first embroidery, we are going to start with a simple shape with a one color stitch.

1. Define the workspace (File > Document Properties) to the hoops capacity.

   | Hoop Size (workspace) in mm | Hoop name |
   | --------------------------- | --------- |
   | 140 x 140                   | SQ14      |
   | 230 x 230                   | SQ23      |
   | 230 x 300                   | GR        |
   | 100 x 40                    | FA10      |
   | 220 x 220                   | ASQ22     |

2. Draw a shape (circle, square, retangle or any other shape is fine).
3. Convert the shape to a path (Path > Object to Path).
4. With the newly created path, you want to run Params (Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Params) you will see the simulation pop up, and it will update as you change the values in the params. After you are done updating the numbers click on Apply and Quit.
5. Save file as a .jef (Janome Embroidery Format) file - copy to a USB drive.

ðŸ’¡TIP: Build your drawing in layers. Fill pattern at the bottom and then work on a new layer.

## Using the Embroidery Machine

1. Check if the machine is threaded properly.
2. Plug in your USB located at the right side of the machine.
3. Select the proper embroidery hoop that you wish to use.
4. Set your fabric and ensure that you have a stabilizer (embroidery backing) at the back of your fabric of where your design will be.

7. Select the file that you want to embroider. You will then get a popup of the hoop confirmation press OK.
8. Once that is all done press START on the machine.

**NOTE:** If the Embroidery machine is not threaded please refer to [Threading the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr2DjmayZlk&t=553) video to help you thread the machine, do keep in mind that the auto threader on our machine does not work properly, so you would have to manually insert the thread into the needle head once you reach that part.

### Congratulations on your first embroidery! ðŸŽ‰
