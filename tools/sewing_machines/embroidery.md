# Embroidery Machine

Janome sewing machine horizon memory craft 15000 is an embroidery machine that is used in the Labs.

The following guide explains how to use the embroidery machine, along with the relevant steps one has to take. The guide assumes that you have already installed inkscape.

# Inkscape Plugin Requirements

Ink/Stitch is an [Inkscape plugin](https://inkstitch.org/). Which means you have to have Inkscape installed in order to continue with the tutorial.

Click on install ink/stitch -> Ensure that you download the proper plugin for your respective laptop OS. Once you have downloaded the file and went through the installation prompt - you would want to restart Inkscape.

To know that the plugin was installed properly you can find the extension under Extensions > Ink/Stitch and nothing is grayed out.

- If you don't already have Inkscape installed on your computer, click <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/" target="_blank">here</a> to download and install.

## Getting started with Ink/Stitch

To do your first embroidery, we are going to start with a simple shape with a one color stitch.

1. Define the workspace to the hoops capacity.

   | Hoop Size (workspace) in mm | Hoop name |
   | --------------------------- | --------- |
   | 140 x 140                   | SQ14      |
   | 230 x 230                   | SQ23      |
   | 230 x 300                   | GR        |
   | 100 x 40                    | FA10      |
   | 220 x 220                   | ASQ22     |

2. Draw a shape (circle, square, retangle or any other shape is fine).
3. Convert the shape to a path (Path > Object to Path).
4. With the newly created path, you want to run Params (Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Params) you will see the simulation pop up, and it will update as you change the values in the params. After you are done updating the numbers click on Apply and Quit.
5. Save file as a .jef (Janome Embroidery Format) file

## Using the Embroidery Machine

2.

**NOTE:** If the Embroidery machine is not threaded please refer to [Threading the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr2DjmayZlk&t=553) video to help you thread the machine, do keep in mind that the auto threader on our machine does not work properly, so you would have to manually insert the thread into the needle head once you reach that part.
