# Circular Saw

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

A circular saw is a power-saw using a toothed or abrasive disc or blade to cut different materials using a rotary motion spinning around an arbor. Circular saw can cut wood of all sorts: dimensional construction lumber, solid hardwood stock, plywood, dense pressure-treated lumber for outdoor projects, engineered sheet goods like MDF and hardboard, and even small pieces of trim and millwork.

## Why

When to use a circular saw:

- rip wood (cut with the grain to create a boardâ€™s width)
- crosscut wood (cut across the grain to establish length)

## Safety

Do not use a saw that vibrates or appears unsafe in any way. Do not force the saw during cutting. Do not cut materials without first checking for obstructions or other objects such as nails and screws. Do not carry the saw with a finger on the trigger switch.

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection
- Avoid loose clothing, hair or jewelry that can be pulled into the saw.

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a woodshop training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
