# Miter Saw

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

A miter saw or mitre saw is a saw used to make accurate crosscuts and miters in a workpiece by positioning a mounted blade onto a board. Miter saws are primarily used for cutting wood trim and molding, but also can be used to cut metal, masonry, and plastics, provided the appropriate type of blade is used for the material being cut.

## Why

You may wish to use a miter saw when:

If you’re cutting angles in wood, a great way to do it quickly is with a miter saw. It offers a quick, painless way to line up

- Cuts across a board and against the grain are crosscuts.
- A miter cut is an angled cut made along a crosscut face, usually at a 45-degree angle.
- Bevel cuts are angled cuts made relative to the edge of the board.
- The most complicated angled cut combines both miter and bevel cuts. You are cutting it at an angle across the grain while also cutting it at an angle relative to the wood’s edge.

## Safety

- Only cut one work piece at a time.
- Allow motor to reach full speed before cutting
- Use a dust extraction system, and/or respirator or dust mask.
- Keep hands out of the path of the blade.
- Keep the work area clean. Cluttered areas and benches invite incidents.

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a drill press training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
