# Table Saw

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

A table saw (also known as a sawbench or bench saw) consisting of a circular saw blade, mounted on an arbor powered by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through the top of a table, which supports the material being cut, which is usually wood.

## Why

You may wish to use a table saw when:

A table saw will help you make accurate and precise cuts on wood. They make three types of cuts: cross cut, and ripping cut.

- Crosscut: A cut that is made against the grain or narrow grain of a board.
- Ripping cut: A cut along the length of a board.

You don't want to use a table saw when:

- You need to make curved cuts
- You want to cut ferrous metals, like cast iron or steel
- You want to cut plastic

## Safety

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection
- Stand to one side of the saw blade when cutting; do not allow others to stand in direct line with the saw blade while the saw is operating.
- Use the blade guard that comes with the saw.
- Never reach over the saw blade to remove or hold down the piece of wood.
- Always use a push stick when ripping wood on your saw. This tool keeps your fingers away from the blade and help prevents kickback of the wood.
- Do not wear work gloves when operating a table saw.
- Never cut a piece of wood on a table saw without using a guide

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a saws training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
