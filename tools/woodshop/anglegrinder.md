# Angle Grinder

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

An angle grinder, also known as a side grinder or disc grinder, is a handheld power tool used for grinding and polishing.

## Why

When to use an angle grinder:

- You want to remove excess material like rust or cleaning up jagged edges.
- Sharpening metal, tools, or stone.

When not to use an angle grinder:

- Do NOT use in areas where there is grain dust or other combustible dust accumulation.

## Safety

Having both hands on the grinder gives you far more control and much better leverage. You always want to have one hand on the side handle and one hand on the back of the grinder. Additionally, never carry the angle grinder with your finger on the power button.

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a woodshop training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
