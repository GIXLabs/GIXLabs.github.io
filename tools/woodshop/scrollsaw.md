## Description

A scroll saw is a small electric or pedal-operated saw used to cut intricate curves in wood, metal, or other materials.

## Why

You may wish to use a scroll saw when:

- You want to cut intricate curves and joints, a task they can complete quickly and with great accuracy.

## Safety

- Never wear gloves, a tie, loose clothing, a watch, rings, or jewelry when using a scroll saw. Tie long hair back.
- Prior to starting, assure the blade guard is in place and belt guard is closed and tight.
- Your fingers must be positioned more than two inches from the blade when the saw is operating.
- Always use the correct saw blade for the cutting task. Use a narrow blade for curving cuts.

### Equipment

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a drill press training from the Makerspace staff or crew.
