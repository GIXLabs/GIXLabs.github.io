# Nail Gun

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

A nail gun, nailgun or nailer is a form of hammer used to drive nails into wood or other materials. Nail guns have in many ways replaced hammers as tools of choice among builders.

## Why

Nail guns are popular for when you have multiple nails to drive and are looking for efficient use of time. You can quickly move through many jobs when using a nail gun without worry of fatigue. Plus it frees up one of your hands to work with, unlike when using a traditional method of hammering a nail into place.

## Safety

- Never use a nailer with a broken or modified trigger.

- Never hold down the trigger unless you intend to fire,
  and never fire until the nose is firmly on the workpiece.

- Never rest the tool against your body or point it at
  anyone, even if it is empty or disconnected from the air
  supply

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a woodshop training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
