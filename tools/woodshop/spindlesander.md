# Spindle Sander

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

A spindle sander is a motorized, power-sander that was created and designed to help you achieve a smooth finish on exterior curves and other detail-work on wood.

## Why

When to use a spindle sander:

- to help you achieve a smooth, flat finish to wood pieces, mostly those that are detailed or have curved edges. It typically uses an 80 or 150 grit sandpaper.

When not to use a spindle sander:

- if it's a small or thin hand-held work pieces.
- the stock that has loose knots, splits, defects or foreign objects (e.g., metal, stone) in it.

## Safety

Do not wear loose clothing, work gloves, neckties, rings, bracelets or other jewelry that can become entangled with moving parts.

- Always keep your hands out of the path of the sander and away from the sanding sleeves.
- Avoid hand positions where a sudden slip could cause your hand to move into the spindle.
- Do not reach underneath the workpiece or around the sanding sleeve while the spindle is rotating.

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection
- Tie up hair

### Sand paper

Sandpaper grit to use on a spindle sander:

- Using progressively finer abrasive grit as you progress will provide the best results for any sanding operation. Begin sanding with a coarse grit (60 to 100), then move on to a medium grit (120 to 180), and finally a fine grit (220 and higher). With each progressive sanding, you will reduce any marks or abrasions caused by the previous sanding's coarser grit. The smoothest and best results will come from progressive sanding.

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a woodshop training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
