# Belt Sander

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

Belt sanders are multiuse tools. They are commonly used for trimming to a scribed line, sanding very rough surfaces, leveling surfaces (like a replacement board in a hardwood floor) and freehand rounding and shaping.

## Why

You may wish to use a belt sander when:

- As a result of that power, you can quickly strip down a piece of wood and remove just about anything from it, including numerous layers of paint.
- Remove any material and the best sander for aggressive removal down to the wood; they are the ideal sander for large areas since they work with the grain.

## Safety

- Unplug the tool before changing belts or emptying the dust bag.
- Don’t breathe dust. It’s not just unpleasant; it’s bad for you. Wear a dust mask while sanding, unless you rig up a shop vacuum for dust collection.
- Make sure the trigger is off before plugging the sander in.

### Equipment

In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have:

- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection

### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a drill press training from the Makerspace staff or crew.

## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
