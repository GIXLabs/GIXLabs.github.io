# Trim Router

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

A trim router has become an indispensable power tool in most workshops, and for good reason. They can be used for a wide variety of tasks including routing for inlay cavities and hinge mortises, rounding over edges, flush trimming hardwood edging, and a whole lot more.

## Why

When to use a trim router:

- Itâ€™s the best for smoothing off the edges.

- When the wood piece has a tighter, narrower surfaces such as aprons attached to table legs.
- Duplicating parts
  - Trim routers with top-bearing pattern bits make short work of routing out wood around a template, perfect for making multiples of the same item.
- Profiling edges
  - Perfect for edge profiling, provided you make several careful passes to reach your cutting depth.
- Trimming shelf lipping
  - Rather than trying to sand veneer and risk damage, a trim router can cut the solid wood lipping flush.

When to not use a trim router:

- You are doing a heavy-duty task(s).
- You must work within a specified range of the power socket because the trim router is not portable and is powered by a power cable from the main grid.
