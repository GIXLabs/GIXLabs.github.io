The Roland GS-24 is the vinyl cutter that the Lab uses.

The following guide explains how to use the vinyl cutter with the Roland GX-24, along with the relevant steps one has to take. The guide assumes one already has Adobe Illustrator installed.

2. Click on install and it should automatically install to your Illustrator - you will need to restart Illustrator and verify that it is properly installed. (Window > Extentions > Roland CutStudio)

## Getting started

These steps are to help you get started with the vinyl cutter by starting off with cutting text using the Roland GS-24.

The screenshots below are based on Essential Classics workspace.

1. Open up the Roland CutStudio extension.
2. Under model you want to select GS-24.
3. Select the type tool and type in the text you want cut out.
4. You then want to leave the type tool and switch over to the selection tool to select the text and expand it. (Object > Expand) Once you have done that you can see on the CutStudio that the text has appeared.

### We are now going to switch over to the cutter

1. You want to feed the vinyl into the cutter.
2. There is a tension lever where you want to lift up to secure your vinyl.
3. With the tension lever lowered - you want to adjust the rollers to the white bars of the vinyl as they need to be on or under it. You want to space the rollers as far as possible (depending on the length of your vinyl) as this allows the materials in the center to be cut.

4. The machine will be able to tell that you have loaded a roll of vinyl, and it will prompt to ask if it is a roll (this can be seen on the screen on the machine). Press Enter
