The Roland GS-24 is the vinyl cutter that the Lab uses.

The following guide explains how to use the vinyl cutter with the Roland GS-24, along with the relevant steps one has to take. The guide assumes one already has Adobe Illustrator installed.

## Part 1: Installation

1. Install the Illustrator plugin [here](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/15901/roland-cutstudio-plugin-for-ai).
2. Click on install and it should automatically install to your Illustrator - you will need to restart Illustrator and verify that it is properly installed. (Window > Extentions > Roland CutStudio)

### Part 2: Illustrator

These steps are to help you get started with the vinyl cutter by starting off with cutting text using the Roland GS-24.

The screenshots below are based on Essential Classics workspace.

3. Select the type tool and type in the text you want cut out.

### Part 3: Loading the Vinyl

1. You want to feed the vinyl into the cutter.
2. There is a tension lever where you want to lift up to secure your vinyl.
3. With the tension lever lowered - you want to adjust the rollers to the white bars of the vinyl as they need to be on or under it. You want to space the rollers as far as possible (depending on the length of your vinyl) as this allows the materials in the center to be cut.

4. The machine will be able to tell that you have loaded a roll of vinyl, and it will prompt to ask if it is a roll (this can be seen on the screen on the machine). Press Enter

### Part 4: Removing Unwanted Materials

There is no right way to remove the unwanted materials around the lettering. You are welcome to remove it any way you want it, but here are some helpful tips.

1. There are 2 main methods: â€˜Peelingâ€™ and â€˜Pickingâ€™.
2. Peeling is the process of removing the outline or large chunks of material with little detail.

   a. Pull the excess vinyl as close to the horizontal as you can when peeling; this will help the desired vinyl's corners adhere to the surface.

3. Picking uses a scalpel instead of your fingers for smaller, more detailed areas.

   a. Stabbing small pieces of vinyl work if you are
   struggling to lift an edge away from the main viny.

### Part 5: Transferring Tape

1. Cut off an appropriate size of transfer tape from the roll.
2. Take your transfer tape and starting from one corner, slowly place your transfer down flat on the transfer tape, ensuring no creases.
