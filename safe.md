# Rules
We have a few rules in the Prototyping Labs to help everyone use this shared space safely. There is never a circumstance where these rules may be broken, though the implementation of them may have some flexibility.
1. Be safe.
2. Be respectful of other users.
3. Make cool stuff.

# Policies
Our policies are the implementation details for the above rules. If you find that one of these policies violates a rule, the rule takes precedence.


# Standard Operating Procedures
Each of our tools have standard operating procedures (SOPs) designed to keep you safe and help you accomplish your goals with those tools. They are not a substitution for training on the tools, but work well as a reminder if it has been a while since you used the tool. More information on each of the tools can also be found in the Tools section of this site. If you have questions, please ask a member of the Prototyping Labs Staff
