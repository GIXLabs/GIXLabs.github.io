# Drill Press

## Description

<!-- ![Band Saw](/assets/images/tools/band_saw.jpeg) -->

The drill press is a versatile machine that uses a multiple-cutting-edged drill bit secured in a rotating chuck to bore and drill holes, normally into wood stock.

## Why

You may wish to use a drill press when: 
- You want to drill holes consistently
- Enlarge holes with a boring tool or finishing holes with a reamer
- Produce threads in a hole with the aid of a special tapping attachment 

<!-- You don't want to use a drill press when:
- You need precisely straight cut -->

## Safety

Let the spindle stop of its own accord after turning the power off. **Never** try to stop the spindle with your hand.

### Equipment
In addition to standard woodshop safety equipment, you will want to have: 
- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection


### Trainings

Make sure you have completed the proper online safety training and have attended a drill press training from the Makerspace staff or crew.


## Operation

Make sure you're fully trained and are wearing proper protective equipment at all times before using the tool.
