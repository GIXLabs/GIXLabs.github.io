> Some recommended links related to GitHub Actions and Jekyll.


## GitHub Actions docs

- [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) listed under GitHub features.
- [Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) under GitHub help.


## Actions

Some available actions for your workflow.

Also try a [Jekyll](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=jekyll) search in the GitHub Marketplace.


### Jekyll + GitHub Pages actions

Links are for the GH Actions Marketplace

- [Jekyll Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-actions) - used by this project. It is a docker-based action.
- [Jekyll Action TS](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-action-ts) - a fork of the above but with TypeScript and without Docker, so it is lighter.
- [Jekyll Deploy GH Pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-deploy-gh-pages)



### Starter workflows

If you create a new action through the Actions tab, you'll see this Jekyll action there. You might have to click the _more..._ button.

That action references [jekyll.yml](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/master/ci/jekyll.yml) in the [actions/starter-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) repo.

That unfortunately does't provide any info though on what you do after a successful build in terms of publishing and viewing results.

This Action was not used for this site and is not covered in more detail.
