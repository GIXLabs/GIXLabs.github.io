# Welcome to the GIX Prototyping Lab!
The Prototyping Lab is where you get to work on your physical prototypes. Whether you've got a fully thought-out idea or just the start of one, we're here to help you.

This site is broadly divided into three kinds of articles:
- How To:  articles to both get you started and help you with common problems people run into in the Prototyping Lab
- Tools: Detailed articles on the individual tools that include links to our standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Safety, Rules, and Policies: Policies around use of the Prototyping Lab, including general safety and material usage.

# Where to Start
If you are new to the Prototyping Lab, we recommend you start with either the [First 3D Print](https://gixlabs.github.io/how_to/first_threed.html) article or [First Laser Cut](https://gixlabs.github.io/how_to/first_lasercut.html) article.

# Help Us Grow
If you have articles you'd like to see or if you find errors, let us know. Reach out to any member of the Prototyping Lab staff and we'll be happy to help. You can also submit an [issue via GitHub](https://github.com/GIXLabs/GIXLabs.github.io/issues).
