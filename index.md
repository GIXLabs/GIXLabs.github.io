# Welcome to the GIX Prototyping Labs!

The Prototyping Labs is where you get to work on your physical prototypes. Whether you've got a fully thought-out idea or just the start of one, we're here to help you.

This page is where we keep our institutional knowledge on what tools we have, their associated processes, and a selection of how-to content on common tasks in the Labs. For example, want to find out more about our bandsaw, check [this article](https://gixlabs.github.io/tools/woodshop/bandsaw.html). If you're looking to speed up your 3D prints, [click here](https://gixlabs.github.io/how_to/aa4_printers.html).

# Help Us Grow
If you have articles you'd like to see or if you find errors, let us know. Reach out to any member of the Prototyping Labs staff and we'll be happy to help. You can also submit an issue via GitHub.
