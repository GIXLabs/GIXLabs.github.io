# Getting Started
If you have never used parametric CAD before, it can be a bit overwhelming to get started. We recommend Fusion 360, by Autodesk, as it has a free personal license and integrates well with other systems in the Prototyping Lab (designing circuit boards and CNC routing).

We recommend you go through these articles in this order. Many tutorials are aimed towards people who want to use CAD for a living, so they cover all of the features. We have chosen these videos to teach you the bare minimum to get started. From there, we expect you will learn new features when there is a shape that you cannot create with your current knowledge.

# Sketches
Most parametric CAD programs, like Fusion 360, have a workflow of 2D sketch to 3D body. These two tutorials from Autodesk will show you the basics of drawing sketches and dimensioning them in Fusion 360.

# Extrudes
One of the easiest to understand methods of transforming a 2D sketch into a 3D body is through the Extrude command. Extrude takes a sketch and just extends it into a 3D shape. This Autodesk tutorial will walk you through the basics of using the Extrude command.

# Fillet
No one likes sharp corners on products. Luckily, Fusion 360 makes it really easy to round over sharp inside and outside corners using the Fillet command.

# Emboss/Deboss
Some of the Fabrication (TECHIN 511) assignments will require you to add your logo or name to an object. The Emboss/Deboss command makes this really easy.

# Importing Vector Art
Sometimes you will want to take a 2D shape you have designed and pull it into Fusion 360 to either serve as a base for your design or as decoration. This can be done by exporting SVG files, such as those made by Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

# Engineering Drawings
Machine shops and manufacturers often require engineering drawings to make your part. Fusion 360 also has an environment for making these shop drawings. Many Fabrication course (TECHIN 511) assignments also require engineering

# Sharing
Instead of passing files around like it is 2007, you can share your Fusion 360 models through links. This allows others to view your model in a browser, which helps with both communication and collaboration.

# Output for 3D printing
When you are done with your 3D model, you will need to export it either as an stl or 3mf file to 3D print it. We recommend stl for now as 3mf also captures position, which can make it hard to orient in the slicing software (Cura).
