If you've never used parametric CAD before, it can be a bit overwhelming to get started. We recommend Fusion 360 as it has a free personal license and integrates well with other systems in the Prototyping Lab (designing circuit boards and CNC routing).

We recommend you go through these articles in this order. Many tutorials are aimed towards people who want to use CAD for a living, so they cover all of the features. We have chosen these videos to teach you the bare minimum to get started. From there, we expect you'll learn new features when there's a shape that you can't create with your current knowledge.

# Sketches
Most parametric CAD programs, like Fusion 360, have a workflow of 2D sketch to 3D body.
