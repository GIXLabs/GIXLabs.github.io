# Purpose

This is where we keep our instructional content on various tools and techniques used in the Prototyping Labs. Think of this as the place we store the verbs of the Prototyping Labs. For more information on the tools (nouns), such as safety information, please visit the [Tools]() section.

Below are some of the categories users look for often. Some articles show up in multiple sections so you can more easily find them. We also recommend the use of your browser's search function (ctrl-f or cmd-f) to find the relevant article.
