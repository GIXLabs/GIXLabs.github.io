# Your First 3D Print

## Before You Print
You will need to download and install Ultimaker Cura. The latest version can be found [here](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura).

You will also need a file to print. We suggest this [GIX keychain](/assets/stl/GIX_keychain). You can find something from Thingiverse.com or design something in your CAD package of choice (the Prototyping Labs uses Fusion 360), but we recommend the keychain to start.

## Set Up Cura

## Slice Your Model

Load the file in Cura. Click on the model and rotate it using the toolbar on the left.

Change the layer height to .2 mm.

Although this model does not need supports, it is best to leave this option checked to prevent many failed prints in the future.

Click Slice.

Save the sliced file to a thumb drive (show picture of where thumb drives are).

## Load Your File on a Printer

Find an available printer.

Clear the error message on the printer.

Select Print, then your file should be the top one.

## Finishing Up

Wait for the bed to cool, then the part should pop off the bed with little effort.
