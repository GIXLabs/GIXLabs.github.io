# Why Vector Graphics?
Most images you see are bitmaps (collections of pixels, also sometimes called raster images), which become pixellated when you zoom in. **Vector graphics don't**, you can zoom in as much as you want and a vector graphic won't become pixellated. Instead of being essentially an Excel spreadsheet with boxes colored in (bitmaps), vector graphics are collections of points, and curviture associated with those points, which are rendered using a bunch of math (which luckily you don't need to know).

Try zooming in on this image where the left side is a bitmap and the right is a vector.

This turns out to be really handy when creating images that may need to be scaled for different displays (phone, jumbotron, webpage, banners, swag, etc) and for telling a laser where to cut.

[This video shows a very quick overview of the features and uses of Inkscape.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa6a7oz7vEE) Please note that Inkscape recently updated its user interface, so many of the icons may look different, but they are still in the same place and do the same thing.

# Working with Shapes
Luckily, you do not need to work directly with nodes most of the time. Inkscape has many basic shapes implemented, which you can add and subtract from each other to form more complicated shapes.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-EH-9GaUOs) walks through many of the features of different shapes, such as how to scale and round corners. It also covers how to add and subtract shapes using path commands like Union and Difference as well as how to group shapes together.

[Inkscape also has its own text-heavy tutorials on basic shapes.](https://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/shapes/tutorial-shapes.html)

# Editing Nodes
Sometimes you will need to edit those nodes directly to get exactly the result you want, such as when you are tracing an existing image or trying to create more organic shapes.

Text to path for laser cutting
Clipping (and possibly making a bitmap copy to reduce the size of the file)
Mirror/flip, rotate

Dimensioning (e.g. is your rectangle going to come out of the laser cutter the right size :) )
Layers, lock/hide, group, ungroup
Outline/offset stroke
