# Making a nametag using Inkscape / Illustrator and Glowforge

---

## Two Rules of the Glowforge (or any laser)

1. Don't leave cuts unattended.
1. Talk to staff before using your own materials.

## New to Glowforge?

If you haven't used the Glowforge yet, click [here](https://github.com/GIXLabs/GIXLabs.github.io/blob/main/how_to/first_lasercut.md) to learn how to use the Glowforge.

## Download Inkscape

If you don't already have Inkscape installed on your computer, click [here](https://inkscape.org/release/) to download.

## Download the Nametag template

- Select one of the nametag template files from below.

- Locker Name Tag

- Person Name Tag

## Open the Template File

- Use File -> Open and navigate to where you saved the template file. Select the template file and click 'Open'.

## Use the text tool to add your name to the template

- You can either select the 'Text' tool on the left side tool panel, or use the default keyboard shortcut 'T' to activate the tool.

- In the upper left corner you will see a drop down where you can select the font, font type, and font size. Typically it is reccomended to use a bold font as it helps with pathing and etching.

- Once you click on the page, you can type your name. After you've typed your name hit the escape key a few times to exit the text tool and reselect the 'select' tool

## Object Path

- With the text selected, use the 'Object' drop down menu to select 'Object Path'. This will allow Glowforge's software to detect the edges of the text.

## Bonus: Add a graphic

- If you'd like to add a graphic to your image, it is reccomended that you look for vector graphics or clip art that is black and white.

## Save file, export as SVG

- Use File -> Save to save a local version of your Inkscape file to your computer. Be sure to rename the file so you don't overwrite the template.

- With all contents of the name tag selected, use File -> Export to open the export window on the right side of the page. Then, check the box 'Export Selected Only', and select 'Plain SVG' from the file type drop down. Last, change the file export path if desired and click 'Export' at the bottom of the page.

## Selecting an Available Glowforge

- Once you have upload your file select the available Glowforge to do your cut.

## Selecting Your Material from Glowforge Presets

- Grab a piece of 0.125 inch MDF from the material supplies and place it in the bed of the machine. Try to use a piece that already has a few cuts in it. The length and width of the board do not matter very much as you can scale your design to fit.
- Select Medium Draftwood in the top lefthand corner. You may have to use the search bar to find it.

- You can find the proper settings on [this page](https://gixlabs.github.io/tools/laser_cutters/glowforge.html) for all of the other materials in the Prototyping Labs

## Changing Cut Settings

- On the lefthand side you can click on the item you want to change the settings for from engrave, score, or cut. You do not need to mess with Power and Speed settings. If you see those, just press Back.

- Check to make sure that the outline of the template is being 'cut' in the Glowforge app, and that your name and the graphic (if you added one) are showing as 'engrave'.

## Positioning Your Cut

- To change the positioning of the artwork select the artwork and drag it to the area where you want to cut it.
- You are able to rotate and scale your artwork as well.
- If the Print button still says "No Artwork," you will need to move your artwork closer to the center of the bed.

<!-- ![MoveArtwork](/assets/images/first_laser_cut/move_artwork.gif) -->

**NOTE:** This will help you maximize the space left for other cuts. DON'T PUT YOUR CUT IN THE CENTER OF A FRESH SHEET OF MATERIAL. Place it near the edges so others can use the remainder of that sheet. Leave a little room around the edge (1/8" or 3 mm) for camera positioning error.

## Cutting Your Name Tag Design

- Go to the upper right corner and click on Print.
- The first time you print, it will give you some safety warnings, which should match our rules, and a warning about no Proofgrade materials, which you can ignore. Your download bar might obscure the "I understand" button.
- Once you have done that and you see the provided estimated time of your cut, you will see the **button on the Glowforge machine** blink. Press on the button and watch the laser do your cut.

## Removing Your Work

- Once the fan has stopped running, you can open the lid and remove your finished part.
